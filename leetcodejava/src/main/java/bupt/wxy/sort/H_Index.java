 274. H-Index

 Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

 According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

 For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        Arrays.sort(citations);
        int len=citations.length;
        int h=len;
        while (h>0&&citations[len-h]<h){
            h--;
        }
        return h;
    }
}
