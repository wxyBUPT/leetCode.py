 Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i and j (i ≤ j), inclusive.

 The update(i, val) function modifies nums by updating the element at index i to val.
 Example:
 Given nums = [1, 3, 5]

 sumRange(0, 2) -> 9
 update(1, 2)
 sumRange(0, 2) -> 8
 Note:
 The array is only modifiable by the update function.
 You may assume the number of calls to update and sumRange function is distributed evenly.
